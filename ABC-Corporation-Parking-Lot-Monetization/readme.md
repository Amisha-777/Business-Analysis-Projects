# ABC Corporation Parking Lot Monetization Project
This repository contains the project deliverables for the **ABC Corporation Parking Lot Monetization Project**. This project was developed as a college project and outlines a comprehensive plan to convert an underutilized parking lot into a revenue-generating asset while preserving employee benefits.

## Project Background

- **Operational Efficiency:** Implement an automated check-in/out and payment system to ensure seamless operations with minimal disruption.
- **Customer Experience:** Enhance safety, convenience, and overall user experience through clear guidelines, designated parking spaces, and reliable support via an emergency help desk.

## Desired Outcomes
