# Optimizing Operations: MIS Recommendations for Small Business

## üìå Project Overview  
This project focuses on **business process analysis** and **Management Information System (MIS) implementation** for a small business. The case study, **Everest Cuisine**, a restaurant facing operational inefficiencies, required a structured approach to optimize its workflows.  

By leveraging **Odoo ERP** for **Order-to-Cash** and **Homebase HRM** for **Hire-to-Retire**, this project successfully enhanced business efficiency, employee management, and customer transactions.  

> **Note:** Some links in the documentation might not work as the project was created using the **free versions** of both **Odoo** and **Homebase**. Free-tier access limitations may affect link availability over time.
